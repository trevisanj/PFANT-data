PFANT atomic lines file generated rom VALD3 line list extended format,
range 3000-10000 angstrom.

Conversion was made using vald3-to-atoms.py and tune-zinf.py in 2018-03-06.

File has 289060 lines.

I suggest to generate another smaller file containing the region of
interest (+- interval to the sides) because this one takes some time to be loaded by PFANT
