**UPDATE** still the official PFANT/data/common/molecules.dat

File molecules.dat in this folder was the "official" one until 2018-03-04, 
i.e., this file was in PFANT/data/common/molecules.dat. 

The data inside is described in Coelho (2005).

This file is essentially one called originally "moleculagrade.dat", which
I (JT) received around April/2015. But I changed a few things.

Differences between "moleculagrade.dat" and the file herein contained 
"molecules.dat":

    - The title row for each molecule has changed: 
      * the name has changed to contain the system specification; 
      * the syntax of the list of (v', v'') was standardized (when 
        this list was available)
        
    - Some wavelengths that were obviously wrong were corrected
